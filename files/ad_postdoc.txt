Postdoctoral Researcher Positions in Data Mining and Machine Learning at The Ohio State University

Multiple postdoctoral researcher positions are available at The Ohio State University (OSU). The postdoctoral researcher is expected to develop novel data mining/machine learning algorithms for analyzing complex biomedical data (e.g., electronic health records, hospital claims, gene expression, and medical images) to solve tough problems in healthcare and medicine (e.g., clinical decision support, disease phenotyping, and drug repurposing). The postdoctoral researcher will work closely with Dr. Ping Zhang (https://web.cse.ohio-state.edu/~zhang.10631/) in Artificial Intelligence in Medicine (AIMed) Lab at OSU.
